# KPI-Driven Sales Performance Management System

## Business Challenge

A leading financial institution needed to optimize performance tracking and incentive calculations for 2000+ sales representatives across multiple regions. Their existing manual processes were time-consuming (taking 2 full days to process), prone to errors, and lacked transparency for the sales team.

## My Approach

I recognized this as a complex data integration and process automation opportunity with significant business impact potential. The solution needed to balance technical efficiency with user-friendly interfaces for sales managers.

### Project Phases:

1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Conducted workshops with sales leadership to map out KPI requirements
   - Analyzed existing incentive structure and identified improvement opportunities
   - Documented data sources and integration points

2. **System Architecture**
   - Designed comprehensive KPI tracking system using SAS, SQL, and Cognos
   - Created automated incentive calculation engine with real-time territory analysis
   - Implemented parallel processing using unix shell scripts for efficient data handling

3. **Implementation & Training**
   - Built interactive dashboards for performance visualization at individual/team levels
   - Developed auditable calculation methodology
   - Trained managers on system usage and KPI interpretation
