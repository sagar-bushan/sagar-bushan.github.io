## Code Snippets
```sql
-- Example of sales performance analysis
WITH sales_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        sales_rep_id,
        territory_id,
        SUM(sale_amount) as total_sales,
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as unique_customers,
        AVG(deal_size) as avg_deal_size,
        SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'Won' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as won_deals,
        COUNT(*) as total_deals
    FROM sales_data
    WHERE date_created BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
    GROUP BY sales_rep_id, territory_id
)
SELECT 
    sm.*,
    total_sales / NULLIF(total_deals, 0) as avg_sale_value,
    won_deals::FLOAT / NULLIF(total_deals, 0) as win_rate,
    total_sales / territory_target.target_amount as target_achievement
FROM sales_metrics sm
JOIN territory_target ON sm.territory_id = territory_target.territory_id;

-- Example of commission calculation
SELECT 
    sales_rep_id,
    total_sales,
    CASE 
        WHEN target_achievement >= 1.2 THEN total_sales * 0.15
        WHEN target_achievement >= 1.0 THEN total_sales * 0.10
        ELSE total_sales * 0.05
    END as commission_amount
FROM sales_metrics;
