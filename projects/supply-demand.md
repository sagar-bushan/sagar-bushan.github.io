# Predictive Supply Chain Analytics

## Business Challenge

A manufacturing company was experiencing significant inventory management issues, leading to frequent stock-outs and excess inventory carrying costs. The inventory oscillated between too much and too little stock, directly impacting customer satisfaction and operational expenses.

## My Approach

I addressed this as a forecasting and optimization problem that required both technical solutions and business process alignment. The approach needed to balance inventory optimization with practical operational constraints.

### Project Phases:

1. **Supply Chain Assessment**
   - Analyzed historical demand patterns and seasonality
   - Identified key drivers of supply variability
   - Documented existing inventory management practices

2. **Solution Development**
   - Developed basic demand forecasting model with seasonal adjustments
   - Created inventory optimization framework with safety stock calculations
   - Built automated supply chain dashboard for daily monitoring

3. **Implementation & Integration**
   - Integrated solution with existing ERP system
   - Established daily data refresh and exception reporting
   - Created role-specific views for different stakeholders

## Results & Impact
