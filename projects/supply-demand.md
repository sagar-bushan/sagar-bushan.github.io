   - Implemented time series forecasting models
   - Created seasonal adjustment factors
   - Developed promotion impact analysis

2. Inventory Optimization
   - Built safety stock calculator
   - Implemented reorder point optimization
   - Created stock level monitoring system

3. Dashboard Development
   - Developed real-time inventory dashboard
   - Created forecast accuracy tracking
   - Implemented alert system

## Technical Implementation
- **Languages & Tools:**
  - Python (Prophet, statsmodels)
  - SQL for data management
  - Power BI for visualization
- **Key Algorithms:**
  - Prophet forecasting model
  - ABC-XYZ analysis
  - Safety stock optimization

## Results & Impact

## Code Snippets
```python
# Example of demand forecasting
from fbprophet import Prophet

def forecast_demand(df):
    # Prepare data for Prophet
    model = Prophet(
        yearly_seasonality=True,
        weekly_seasonality=True,
        daily_seasonality=False
    )
    
    # Fit model and create forecast
    model.fit(df)
    future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=30)
    forecast = model.predict(future)
    
    return forecast
```

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning for anomaly detection
- Advanced seasonality modeling
- Integration with ERP system
