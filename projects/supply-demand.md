- Cost Analysis Section
  * Holding cost trends
  * Stockout impact
  * Cost optimization opportunities
  * Efficiency metrics

## Sample Code
```python
# Inventory Analytics System
def analyze_inventory_metrics(df):
    """
    Analyze inventory metrics and generate key insights
    """
    # Calculate key metrics
    metrics = {
        'current_stock': df['inventory_level'].sum(),
        'stockout_rate': calculate_stockout_rate(df),
        'holding_cost': calculate_holding_cost(df),
        'forecast_accuracy': calculate_forecast_accuracy(df)
    }
    
    # Generate insights
    insights = generate_insights(metrics)
    
    return metrics, insights

def calculate_stockout_rate(df):
    """
    Calculate stockout rate and identify risk areas
    """
    total_days = len(df)
    stockout_days = len(df[df['inventory_level'] < df['safety_stock']])
    
    return (stockout_days / total_days) * 100

def calculate_holding_cost(df):
    """
    Calculate holding cost and optimization opportunities
    """
    avg_inventory = df['inventory_level'].mean()
    holding_cost_rate = 0.1  # 10% annual holding cost rate
    
    return avg_inventory * holding_cost_rate

def calculate_forecast_accuracy(df):
    """
    Calculate forecast accuracy and identify improvement areas
    """
    mape = calculate_mape(df['forecast'], df['actual'])
    
    return 100 - mape
```
