# Customer Segmentation & Return Rate Optimization

## Business Problem
E-commerce company facing challenges with high return rates and inefficient marketing spend due to lack of customer segmentation. Needed to optimize marketing strategies and reduce return rates while maintaining customer satisfaction.

## Solution Approach
### Data Collection & Preparation
- Integrated data from multiple sources including:
  - Customer transaction history
  - Product returns data
  - Customer service interactions
  - Marketing campaign data
- Performed extensive data cleaning and feature engineering

### Analysis & Implementation
1. Customer Segmentation
   - Implemented RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
   - Applied K-means clustering to identify distinct customer segments
   - Created customer lifetime value predictions

2. Return Rate Prediction
   - Developed machine learning model to predict return probability
   - Identified key factors contributing to returns
   - Implemented real-time scoring system

3. Dashboard Development
   - Created interactive Power BI dashboard for tracking KPIs
   - Implemented drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis
   - Set up automated data refresh pipeline

## Technical Implementation
- **Languages & Tools:**
  - Python (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy)
  - SQL for data extraction
  - Power BI for visualization
- **Key Algorithms:**
  - K-means clustering
  - Random Forest for return prediction
  - RFM scoring algorithm

## Results & Impact
- 25% reduction in return rates
- Improved marketing ROI through targeted campaigns
- Enhanced customer satisfaction scores
- Automated reporting saving 10+ hours weekly

## Code Snippets
```python
# Example of RFM scoring implementation
def calculate_rfm_scores(df):
    # Calculate Recency
    current_date = df['purchase_date'].max()
    df['Recency'] = (current_date - df['last_purchase_date']).dt.days
    
    # Calculate Frequency
    df['Frequency'] = df.groupby('customer_id')['order_id'].transform('count')
    
    # Calculate Monetary
    df['Monetary'] = df.groupby('customer_id')['total_amount'].transform('sum')
    
    return df
```

## Future Enhancements
- Implementation of real-time anomaly detection
- Integration with marketing automation platforms
- Enhanced predictive modeling using deep learning
