# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## Business Challenge

An e-commerce company was experiencing high return rates and inefficient marketing spend due to treating all customers the same way. They needed a data-driven approach to better understand customer behavior patterns and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.

## My Approach

I framed this as a clustering analysis problem that would reveal natural groupings within their customer base. The approach combined statistical techniques with actionable business insights.

### Project Phases:

1. **Data Preparation & Exploration**
   - Collected and cleaned data from 60,000+ customer profiles
   - Analyzed purchase history, browsing behavior, and demographic information
   - Identified key features for segmentation

2. **Segmentation Development**
   - Implemented K-means clustering algorithm to identify distinct customer groups
   - Created automated customer scoring system for segment assignment
   - Developed cohort analysis pipeline for segment tracking over time

3. **Operationalization**
   - Built segment-specific dashboards for marketing and product teams
   - Created recommendation engine for personalized customer interactions
   - Designed monitoring system to track segment evolution
