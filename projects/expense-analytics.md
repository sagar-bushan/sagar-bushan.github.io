# Travel & Expense Analytics System

## Business Challenge

A global professional services firm was struggling with rising travel expenses across the APAC region. They lacked visibility into spending patterns, policy compliance issues, and opportunities for cost optimization.

## My Approach

I approached this as a data mining and anomaly detection challenge with significant cost-saving potential. The solution needed to balance expense control with practical business travel needs.

### Project Phases:

1. **Expense Pattern Analysis**
   - Analyzed historical expense data across departments and regions
   - Identified patterns of non-compliance and excessive spending
   - Benchmarked expenses against industry standards

2. **Solution Development**
   - Built automated expense analysis system with categorization
   - Implemented statistical anomaly detection for unusual spending patterns
   - Created compliance monitoring dashboard with alert mechanisms

3. **Policy Optimization**
   - Provided data-driven recommendations for policy adjustments
   - Developed department-specific spending guidelines
   - Created self-service reporting for managers

## Results & Impact

### Measurable Outcomes:
- **$125,000 reduction** in annual travel expenses
- **Improved policy compliance** across APAC region
- **Enhanced expense monitoring efficiency**
- **Data-driven policy adjustments** based on regional needs
- **Reduced processing time** for expense approval

## Tools & Technologies

- **Data Analysis:** Python
- **Data Processing:** SQL
- **Visualization:** Tableau
- **Automation:** Scheduled reporting

## Lessons Learned

This project demonstrated that even well-established business processes can benefit from data analytics. By presenting expense insights in a non-confrontational way and focusing on system improvements rather than individual behavior, we achieved broad acceptance of the recommendations.
