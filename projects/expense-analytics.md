## Code Snippets
```sql
-- Example of expense analysis by department
WITH dept_expenses AS (
    SELECT 
        department_id,
        expense_category,
        SUM(amount) as total_amount,
        COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
        AVG(amount) as avg_amount,
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY amount) as amount_75th_percentile
    FROM expense_transactions
    WHERE transaction_date >= DATEADD(month, -3, GETDATE())
    GROUP BY department_id, expense_category
)
SELECT 
    d.department_name,
    de.*,
    total_amount / dept_budget.quarterly_budget as budget_utilization
FROM dept_expenses de
JOIN departments d ON de.department_id = d.department_id
JOIN dept_budget ON de.department_id = dept_budget.department_id;

-- Example of policy violation detection
SELECT 
    t.transaction_id,
    t.employee_id,
    t.expense_category,
    t.amount,
    p.max_amount as category_limit,
    CASE 
        WHEN t.amount > p.max_amount THEN 'Amount Exceeded'
        WHEN t.receipt_status = 'Missing' THEN 'Missing Receipt'
        WHEN DATEDIFF(day, t.transaction_date, t.submission_date) > 30 THEN 'Late Submission'
        ELSE 'Compliant'
    END as violation_type
FROM expense_transactions t
JOIN policy_limits p ON t.expense_category = p.expense_category
WHERE t.amount > p.max_amount 
    OR t.receipt_status = 'Missing'
    OR DATEDIFF(day, t.transaction_date, t.submission_date) > 30;
```
