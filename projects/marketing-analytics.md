## Code Snippets
```python
# Example of campaign performance analysis
def analyze_campaign_performance(df):
    # Calculate key metrics by channel
    performance = df.groupby('channel_name').agg({
        'spend': 'sum',
        'impressions': 'sum',
        'clicks': 'sum',
        'conversions': 'sum',
        'revenue': 'sum'
    }).reset_index()
    
    # Calculate derived metrics
    performance['ctr'] = performance['clicks'] / performance['impressions']
    performance['conversion_rate'] = performance['conversions'] / performance['clicks']
    performance['cpa'] = performance['spend'] / performance['conversions']
    performance['roas'] = performance['revenue'] / performance['spend']
    
    return performance

# Example of daily trend analysis
def analyze_daily_trends(df):
    daily_metrics = df.groupby('date').agg({
        'spend': 'sum',
        'conversions': 'sum',
        'revenue': 'sum'
    }).reset_index()
    
    # Calculate 7-day moving averages
    daily_metrics['spend_ma7'] = daily_metrics['spend'].rolling(7).mean()
    daily_metrics['conversion_ma7'] = daily_metrics['conversions'].rolling(7).mean()
    
    return daily_metrics
```
