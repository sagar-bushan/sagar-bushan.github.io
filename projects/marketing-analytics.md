# Multi-Channel Marketing Analytics Platform

## Business Challenge

An e-commerce startup was struggling with escalating customer acquisition costs across multiple marketing channels (Google Ads, Meta, influencer campaigns). They lacked visibility into which channels delivered the best ROI and had no systematic way to optimize their marketing spend.

## My Approach

I approached this as both a data integration and analytics visualization challenge. The key was creating a unified view of performance metrics while implementing attribution modeling that reflected their customer journey.

### Project Phases:

1. **Discovery & Data Mapping**
   - Audited existing data sources and marketing platforms
   - Mapped customer journey touchpoints for attribution modeling
   - Defined KPIs aligned with business objectives

2. **Technical Implementation**
   - Developed Python scripts for API integration with ad platforms
   - Created SQL data warehouse for unified marketing data
   - Built Power BI dashboard with daily refresh cycle

3. **Analytics Framework**
   - Implemented multi-touch attribution model
   - Created ROI calculation engine with scenario modeling
   - Designed anomaly detection for campaign performance
