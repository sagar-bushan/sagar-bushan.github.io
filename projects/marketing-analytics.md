## Code Snippets
```python
# Example of channel attribution scoring
def calculate_channel_attribution(df):
    # Calculate channel contribution
    df['channel_weight'] = df.apply(lambda x: 
        x['conversion_value'] * x['channel_position_weight'], axis=1)
    
    # Aggregate by channel
    channel_impact = df.groupby('channel_name').agg({
        'channel_weight': 'sum',
        'conversions': 'count'
    }).reset_index()
    
    return channel_impact
```
